<p style="font-size:20px"> I was interested in taking this class as I wanted to learn more about the process 
  of creating web pages and combining these new skills with others I've learned so far 
  at Tufts. In the post-bacc program, I did not have as much freedom to branch out with my courses, but
now that I am in the Masters program I've been given more options in terms of courses to choose from and Web
programming definitely caught my eye. In undergrad and for my first classes at Tufts I mainly focused on utilizing
C++, however in my software engineering course I was able to get some experience with Java programming which can be
verbose but I did enjoy it! Currently, I am taking this Web programming course and the cybersecurity class to branch out
and gain some more skills.</p>

  <p style="font-size:20px"> <a href="https://www.favelagrill.com" target="_blank">Favela Grill</a> is my favorite restaurant currently.
  It is a place me and my family frequent on special occasions, such as birthdays, and we all love the menu and service.
 Their churrasco mixto is what we usually order and it is great.</p>

  <p style="font-size:30px;">This slice is an example of my favorite quick bite to eat while in NYC. A fresh pepperoni slice out of the oven with a hint of parmesan and
    chili flakes is the best!</p>
